This repository contains solutions to coding questions from technical interviews and practice sets that stumped me.

```

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Java files:**
   - Open a terminal in the `src` directory.
   - Run:
     ```powershell
     javac .\main.java
     ```
2. **Run the main program:**
   - Execute:
     ```powershell
     java main
     ```
## File Descriptions
- `main.java`: Demonstrates usage of solutions for Q2 and Q3, prints results to console.
- `q2.java`: Contains logic to process an array of heights and return a specific result list.
- `q3.java`: Contains logic to process a matrix, identifying and transforming a 'Y' shape within it.

## Notes
- Requires Java (JDK 8 or higher).
- `.class` files are generated after compilation.
- The `lib` folder is currently empty or for future dependencies.
- VS Code settings are stored in `.vscode/settings.json`.
